[1;32mAFK allows you to notify others that you are temporarily away from
your keyboard. You type a global command when you leave your keyboard to
let others know you're away. The command is typed as follows:
[33m%s       [32mLets others know you're away from your keyboard
When you return to your keyboard you simply type the command again to let
others know you've returned.
You check on other users and they check on you using the same command
followed by the handle of the person to check. You do not have to type the
entire handle, only enough of it that AFK knows who you mean, just like the
/p paging command. For example, to see if your Sysop is away from the
keyboard you could type:
[33m%s [32msys
Your current setting:
According to AFK, you are currently %s your keyboard.
