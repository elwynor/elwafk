 WHAT IS AFK?

 If you are like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in
 Teleconference, and in the middle of chatting with your friends you have to do
 things like change music, get a Dew, answer the door or your phone, etc. When
 you come back to your keyboard, you often find that people have been talking
 to you and paging you with no clue you were gone. This can be frustrating for
 both you and your friends. AFK gives you a chance to end these frustrations.
 With a simple global command you tell people that you are leaving your
 keyboard, and then tell them when you get back. For example, suppose you are
 in Teleconference and you need to grab a candy bar from the kitchen. You just
 type afk and this will tell AFK you are away from your keyboard. Now if
 someone talks to you or pages you and you don't answer, they can type afk
 <your handle> and they will be told you are away from your keyboard.

 CONFIGURATION

 In LEVEL3, you can set what key is required to use the module.
 
 In LEVEL4, you can choose whether or not to use Teleconference action
 strings upon leaving and returning, or the module's text.  You can set the
 name of the teleconference module of your system (in case you've changed
 it), set the action words for going away and coming back, decide 
 whether or not to change the user's location (and what to set it to) when
 they go away, and set whether or not a user is BUSY when they're away.
 
 There are a few text blocks that can be configured in LEVEL6.
 
 INSTALLATION AND ACTIVATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your Worldgroup server directory, add 
 it to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start 
 Worldgroup!  It's that easy! 

 MODULE HISTORY
 
 AFK was written in August 1995 by "Easy Ed" Erdman of EzSoft. The
 module was available up through Worldgroup 3.0. EzSoft was acquired by
 AdventureComm, which was acquired by Elwynor Technologies in 2004.

 Elwynor Technologies ported the module to Worldgroup 3.2 in May 2021,
 and to Major BBS V10 in June 2024.
